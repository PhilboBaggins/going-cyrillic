Going Cyrillic
==============

> Slang for when a graphical display (LED panel, bit-mapped text and graphics) starts to display garbage, as in "The thing just went Cyrillic on me."

This app is a simulator of that effect. It draws random (green) characters on a black screen while making a delightfully horrible noise.



Development todo list
---------------------

* [ ] Detect significant shock (e.g. dropped phone) and start app so people think the phone is broken
* [ ] More realistic text
* [ ] Alternate more to make it look like a snow crash
* [ ] Instead of drawing on a black screen, consider drawing on a screenshot of the desktop (or other previously visible screen state)
* [ ] Use actual cyrillic characters
